# Implementations of ML Algorithms

As a part of my masters I did many implementation of algorithms within R and Python from scratch. I primarily did these
in notebooks (Rmd or Jupyter Notebooks), in order to describe the implementations to the graders.

These implementations were meant for educational purposes and are not built to be used as production grade implementations.
